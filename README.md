This is a Minecraft mod I wrote in 2011, which was subsequently [posted to r/minecraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/kh1az/i_revised_my_tea_mod_for_18_as_per_all_of_your/). The true source code was lost ages ago - this repository contains a decompiled version of the code, decompiled with `jd-core 1.1.3`.

Theoretically, this code should work with Minecraft Beta 1.8.1, and it probably requires some up-to-date-at-the-time version of Risugami's ModLoader.

This mod represents some of the first "real" code I ever wrote and released, which is why I've archived it here.
